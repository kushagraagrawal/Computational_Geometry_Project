class definitions:-
    Point (for <x,y> points)
        Constructors:-
            Point();
            Point(x,y);
            Point(r,theta,const Point orig);
            Point(const Point &A);
    Polar_Point (for <r,theta> points)
        Constructors:-
            Polar_Point();
            Polar_Point(r,theta);
            Point(x,y,const Point &orig);

"Utility.h"
    signed_area (to check for left/right/colinearity)
    file_read   (to read a set of points from a file to a vector/array)
    file_write  (to write a set of points from a vector/array to a file)
    angle of an edge(two <x,y>points) wrt x axis
    euclidean_Distance(between 2 <x,y> points)
    
Define all classes,functions,etc under namespace cg
Use std:: for std functions.
Use "const &" keyword for function arguements if you don't intend to change their values. (Eg. const Point &A)
